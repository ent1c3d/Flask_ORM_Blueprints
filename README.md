### Description
 If You are Programmer who can't code without Active record pattern, who has experience with Laravel Eloquent or just  like beautiful ORM - this repository if for you.   
 
 The Idea of this repository comes from  [Twittor api], which inspired me to do implementation of Orator(AN ACTIVERECORD ORM FOR PYTHON) and Flask Blueprints architecture.

If you have problem with installing Orator using pip, you can try:

```

### Migrations and seeds
